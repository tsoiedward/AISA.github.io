<h1>AISA</h1>

AI Safety Asia (AISA) is a field-leading non-profit organization dedicated to AI Safety and Governance talent development and upskilling across Asia. We intend to reduce catastrophic AI risks by identifying and closing gaps on policy levers and transnational coordination for safe and governed AI, starting in Southeast Asia. AISA aims to bridge the gap between the Global North and South by fostering local talent, conducting policy research, and promoting intergenerational dialogue on AI safety.
